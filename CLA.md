## 1. Definitions

- "You": the individual or legal entity making a Contribution.
- "Contribution": any code, documentation, tests, assets, or other material submitted to the project.
- "Project": Valdrics and related repository materials maintained by Valdrics-AI.

## 2. Copyright License Grant

You grant Valdrics-AI and downstream recipients a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display your Contributions as part of the Project.

## 3. Patent License Grant

You grant a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license for patent claims you can license that are necessarily infringed by your Contributions alone or by combination of your Contributions with the Project.

## 4. License Flexibility

You acknowledge that the Project may be distributed under source-available, open-source, commercial, or future successor licenses, and you grant rights required for Valdrics-AI to relicense the Project and your Contributions accordingly.
