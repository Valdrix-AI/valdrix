# Valdrix Commercial License

Last updated: February 12, 2026

This document explains when a separate commercial license is required for Valdrix.

The repository license is BSL 1.1 (`LICENSE`). Under that license, using Valdrix to provide a third-party hosted service is restricted. We offer commercial exceptions for those scenarios.

This page is informational and does not grant rights by itself. Rights are granted only through a signed commercial agreement.

## Who Needs a Commercial License

You need a commercial license if your use includes any of the following:

- Running Valdrix as a managed/hosted service for third parties.
- White-labeling Valdrix capabilities as part of your own platform.
- Embedding Valdrix in a commercial product where hosted functionality is exposed to customers.
- MSP or SI operations where Valdrix is provided as an external service rather than a customer-owned deployment.

## Who Usually Does Not Need One

- Organizations self-hosting Valdrix for internal use.
- Consultants helping a customer deploy and operate a customer-owned instance.
- Evaluation, testing, and internal proof-of-concept usage.

## Available Commercial Paths

1. Hosted Service Exception
- For providers who want to offer Valdrix-based services to third parties.

2. OEM / Embedded License
- For vendors embedding Valdrix into another commercial product.

3. Partner / Reseller Agreement
- For implementation and delivery partners with defined distribution and support terms.

## Typical Agreement Topics

- Scope of permitted commercial use.
- Distribution rights and territory.

- Fees, term, renewal, and termination.
